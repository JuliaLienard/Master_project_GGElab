Project: Exploring Transcript divergency in a type I diabetes in vitro model using long read RNA sequencing
-  Ana Conesa's lab

Human pancreatic cells (cell line EndoC-βH1) were co-culture with purified CD4+ T lymphocytes from donors.
Activated T cell stimulation of pancreatic cells during 72 hours (stress condition) or unactivated T cells for the control condition.

After these three days of stimulation, pancreatic β cells are collected and RNA extraction is performed.

The two RNA samples (Control and Stress) were pooled and sequenced on a Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Revio, using the full-length RNA workflow on 1 SMRT Cell 25M.
